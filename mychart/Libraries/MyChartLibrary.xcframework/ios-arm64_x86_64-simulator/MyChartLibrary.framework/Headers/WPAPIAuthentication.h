 * @constant WPAPILoginErrorCodeMaxAttemptsExceededCannotResetPassword - This is returned when user has exhausted the maximum number of password attempts but can not reset their password since the the password recovery URL was not specified in branding settings so we can not jump them to the reset password workflow.
 * @constant WPAPILoginErrorCodeIncorrectPasswordCannotResetPassword - This is returned when user enters the wrong password and they do not have the ability to reset their password and so this can be used to warn users ahead of time that their account will be disabled after they exhaust the max number of password attempts.
 * @constant WPAPILoginErrorCodeServerOverload - The authentication service returned a HTTP status code of 429 indicating that the server is under heavy load. The user should attempt to login later.
