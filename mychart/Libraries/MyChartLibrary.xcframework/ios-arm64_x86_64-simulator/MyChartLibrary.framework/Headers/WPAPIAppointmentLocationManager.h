 * available unless the user re-enables these.
 *
 * WPAPIAccessResult.userDisabledSetting: The user opted out of the feature.

 * This method shows the Appointment Arrival onboarding activity if the user hasn't seen it before. This activity prompts  the user to turn on Location Services and permissions, as well as Bluetooth if your organization uses Bluetooth beacons for this functionality. Once these are enabled, the user can confirm to turn on the Appointment Arrival feature as a whole. The user can toggle this setting later from Account Settings or Appointment Details.

 * Note that consecutive calls to this delegate may supply the same appointment. In addition, the appointment may be nil if no appointment is being monitored.
 * @param delegate The delegate to register for this event.
