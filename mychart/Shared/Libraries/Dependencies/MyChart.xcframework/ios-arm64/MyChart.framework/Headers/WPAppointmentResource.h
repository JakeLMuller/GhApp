 * This object handles two objects on the C# side: AppointmentResource and AppointmentResourceWithDepartmentDetails
 * When parsing the AppointmentResourceWithDepartmentDetails, there will be no CENTER at this root level, it should exist in the Department object.
 *
 * I suppose that at some point we can create some trickery here so when ever someone tries to set/get the center we use the one within the department 
 * but that might make it tricky when we cannot guarantee which object gets set first (center might create a dep then only to have to replaced by XML parser)
